// The default grace window is right and it is also why an operator who stops
// the server, backs up, and purges gets nothing back: every body a purge would
// collect was written in the last hour, or the operator would not be purging.
// The report said "2 spared as too recent to collect" in the middle of a line
// and nothing else. Rule 8, trust the numbers: what was not done is a number
// too, in bodies and in bytes, and the line that carries it says how to get
// them.
//
// seeded holds three versions of note.md. A purge drops the first two, whose
// bodies "version one" and "version two" are 11 bytes each and were written a
// moment ago, so the window spares exactly 2 bodies and 22 bytes.
//
// The lead is asserted with the line, not without it. "spared 2 bodies (22 B)"
// is a substring of both leads, so deleting the whole `reclaimed nothing:`
// branch left the suite green: the one thing the branch exists to say was the
// one thing untested, while docs/server.md quoted it verbatim. Rule 9. See
// TestAPurgeThatReclaimedSomethingDoesNotSayItReclaimedNothing for the other
// lead.
