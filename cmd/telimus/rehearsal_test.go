//go:build rehearsal

// The restore rehearsal, run as its own command and its own CI job.
//
// docs/server.md has carried the rehearsal as prose since the backup was
// written: copy the offsite backup somewhere fresh, verify it deeply, compare
// its newest uid, start a server on it, read a note back. improvements.md
// proposes an eleventh durability rule out of it, "a recovery path tested only
// in docs is a rumour", and the rumour is not that the steps are wrong. It is
// that nobody has run them since the last time the backup format, the schema or
// the startup checks moved.
//
// So this is the runbook, executed, against the built binary rather than
// against run() in this process: the operator's artifact is what has to work,
// and a rehearsal that exercises a function nobody ships is a rumour with a
// test next to it.
//
// Behind a build tag, and not part of `go test ./...`, for the reason the
// stress suite is its own command: a slow end-to-end check folded into six
// hundred unit tests is one a `-run` filter silently skips, and "the tests
// pass" was true once here while the suite that caught the shipped bug had been
// failing for weeks. Its own job so that "the restore rehearsal failed" is a
// sentence CI can say. scripts/check.sh runs it, and the guard in that script
// fails if CI ever runs a step the script does not.

// TestRestoreRehearsal walks the runbook end to end.

// The fixture is generated here rather than checked in, and that is a decision
// rather than convenience. A committed backup directory is a SQLite file and a
// tree of ciphertext bodies: unreviewable in a diff, and stale the moment the
// schema moves. What happens then is that somebody regenerates it from the
// build of the day, at which point it tests exactly what a generated one tests
// and has stopped being an old backup, silently. A fixture that quietly becomes
// something other than what its name says is the failure mode this whole
// project is arranged against, and it would be one more rumour.
//
// What a generated fixture deliberately does not cover is restoring a backup
// taken by an *older* build, which is a real recovery case. That is a schema
// question rather than a restore question, and it is covered where it belongs,
// in internal/store's migration tests, which build databases without the
// columns a later version added and open them. The line between the two is
// worth keeping: this test asks whether the backup the current build takes can
// be served back, and that one asks whether an old database can be opened.
