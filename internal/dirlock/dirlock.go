// Package dirlock is an advisory lock on a data directory.
//
// It exists because the maintenance commands and the server are separate
// processes over one data directory, and the store's own mutex is per process.
// Without this, `telimus purge` run while the server is up would sweep chunk
// bodies with nothing holding off the server's commits, and an entry could be
// committed referencing a body that had just been deleted. That is the exact
// hazard the store's write mutex closes *within* a process, undone by having two.
//
// Locks are advisory and non-blocking. A command that cannot take its lock says
// so and exits, rather than waiting: a backup that silently blocks for an hour
// is a backup that did not run, and nothing would say so until it was needed.

// deletes. The server and the read-only commands hold it shared, so a backup can
// run without stopping the server; purge needs it exclusively, so it refuses
// while a server is up. Splitting them is what lets a backup be both safe and
// non-disruptive, which a single exclusive lock could not do.
