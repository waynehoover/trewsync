// then used again by a new file, and the deletion of *that* file is real and

// row is quieter: a device whose auth_hash has lost a character can never
// match a credential again, so that device is refused with "not authorised",
// which is the same thing the server says to a stranger, and no check anywhere
// ever said the registry was unsound. An invite whose sealed blob is gone
// redeems into a device holding no data key. Neither is reachable from the
// entries walk above, because neither is an entry.
//
// What it checks is what the writes check, by calling the same predicates
// rather than restating them: a row that would be refused today is a fault
// however it came to be there. Lengths and shapes for the identifiers, the
// hash digest, and the sealed blob; the two flags an invite carries; and that
// the vault each row names is a vault this database holds and something has
// claimed, since a device row can only be inserted onto a claimed one.
//
// Deep only, and the count comes back so `verify` can print it. A shallow pass
// leaves Rows at zero and says nothing about the registry rather than
// reporting a clean one it never opened (rule 7).
//
// What it deliberately cannot check:
//
//   - **Whether a credential is the right one.** The server holds digests of
//     keys it has never seen. A hash of the correct shape that is not the
//     hash of any key anybody holds is indistinguishable from one that is,
//     from here and from anywhere else on this machine.
//   - **Whether the sealed blob opens.** It is sealed under an invite key that
//     never reached the server, so its shape is the whole of what can be said
//     about it.
//   - **Timestamps against each other.** created_at and last_seen come from
//     the server's clock, and a clock that went backwards would make an
//     ordering check fire on a vault that is perfectly sound. Only the
//     impossible values are refused: a row made at or before the epoch, and a
//     last_seen before it.
//   - **Rows that are missing.** Nothing here can tell a device that was
//     revoked from one that was lost, because a revocation is a delete and
//     leaves nothing behind. Rule 6 is about entries and does not reach the
//     registry; what answers a lost row is `telimus backup`.
