// The whole feature in one assertion: predict, then purge, then compare.
//
// Reclaimable exists so `stats` and the startup line can say what a purge
// would give back, and the only way that figure is worth anything is if it is
// the same figure the purge then reports. The two are computed by different
// SQL: Purge deletes entries outside the required path and source-retirement
// heads and sweeps what the survivors no longer reference; Reclaimable asks
// the inverse question of the same subquery and walks without deleting.
// Two predicates that must agree
// forever is exactly the kind of pair that drifts, and a preview promising
// space a purge does not free is worse than no preview, because somebody stops
// the server for it.
//
// So this does not check a number against a constant. It checks the prediction
// against the outcome, on a vault with every shape that matters in it: a path
// with history, a path with none, a deleted path, a multi-chunk file, a body
// two versions share, and an orphan no entry ever referenced.
