	// The rule is that every legal message is receivable (S22): a frame the
	// protocol allows must never die at the read limit, because a client whose
	// batch is dropped with no code retries the identical batch for ever. The
	// arithmetic, with every constant it depends on named:
	//
	//   - the largest legal text frame is a putmany at wire.MaxBatchBytes,
	//     16 MiB, enforced on the encoded frame after it is read (S18). A batch
	//     of 256 entries naming 65536 chunks each would be about 1.1 GB and is
	//     not legal, because it is over that cap; the client splits it;
	//   - a single put is one path of store.MaxPathLen plus
	//     store.MaxChunksPerEntry names at 67 bytes each, about 4.4 MB;
	//   - a fetch is at most store.MaxChunksPerEntry names, the same 4.4 MB;
	//   - a chunk body is at most store.ChunkMax, 1 MiB.
	//
	// 32 MiB is twice the largest of those, so a frame between the advertised
	// cap and the read limit is read in full and refused with `toolarge`, and
	// only a frame at twice the cap, which no client that read `ready` sends,
	// meets the bare disconnect. This bounds each session's incoming frame.
	//
	// Before hello nothing has been authenticated, so the limit is 64 KiB: a
	// hello is a vault and device of 64 bytes each, a token, a claim of 43 and
	// a wrapped key of at most 256, a few hundred bytes in all. An unauthenticated

// MinClaimLength is the shortest auth key a vault may be bound to.
//
// A derived key is 43 characters of base64url. Anything much shorter came from
// a client that is not deriving it, and binding a vault to a guessable
// credential is worse than refusing to bind it at all: the refusal is visible
// and the weak key is not.
const MinClaimLength = 32

// DerivedAuth authenticates against a key the client derives from the vault's
// root secret, with a one-time bootstrap token for the very first device.
//
// The point is that there is one secret rather than two. Before this, a vault
// had a root secret that the devices shared and a server token that had nothing
// to do with it, and a pairing string had to carry both. The auth key is now
// another branch of the same HKDF schedule the root produces, so holding the
// root secret is what it means to own the vault.
//
// Since protocol 4 that is ownership rather than access: this key registers a
// device, rewraps the data key and administers the device list, and it may not
// sync. What a device connects with is its own key, checked against its own
// row; see session.go's three hello branches.
//
// The server stores only sha256 of that key. It never needs the key itself: it
// checks an offered one, and a server that held the credential could write to
// the vault it exists only to keep. A stolen disk already yields every byte of
// ciphertext; it should not also yield the ability to add to it.
//
// The bootstrap token is how a vault gets claimed in the first place. The
// server prints one on first run, the first device authenticates with it and
// sends the auth key it wants the vault bound to, and from then on the
// bootstrap opens nothing. Trust on first connection would be simpler and would
// mean whoever reached the port first owned the vault.
//
// # Why the hash is a bare, unsalted SHA-256, and must stay one
//
// The auth key is 256 random bits derived by HKDF from a random root. There is
// nothing to guess, so there is nothing for a salt to defeat and nothing for a
// slow hash to slow down: bcrypt or argon2 here would burn a core on every
// hello for no security and block the accept loop while doing it. That
// reasoning holds only because the input is random and long. It must never be
// reused for anything a person chose, where a fast unsalted hash is exactly
// the wrong tool (I12).
