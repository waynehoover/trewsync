// History is ordered by arrival, and arrival is a uid, so no clock decides
// where a version appears in the list.
//
// This is the evidence behind declining a server-stamped arrival time. The
// concern was that a device with a wrong clock writes entries that sort oddly,
// and the proposed fix was a timestamp the server writes and the UI prefers.
// The ordering half of that concern is already false: `ORDER BY uid DESC` is
// arrival order by construction, so the worst a skewed device can do is put a
// wrong label beside a correctly placed version.
//
// The put here declares a modification time far in the future and lands last
// anyway. If a clock ever gets into this ordering, this test says so before
// anybody has to notice it in a history list.
