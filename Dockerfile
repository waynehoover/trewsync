# A single static binary on an empty filesystem.
#
# Pure-Go SQLite is what makes CGO_ENABLED=0 work, and CGO_ENABLED=0 is what
# makes `scratch` possible. There is no shell in the result, no package manager
# and nothing to update, so the attack surface of the image is the binary.
#
# That is also why `telimus health` exists: a HEALTHCHECK needs something to run,
# and adding curl would mean adding a base image and undoing all of the above.

# Must match the go directive in go.mod, and a test in cmd/telimus asserts it
# does. A builder older than the module needs is a build that fails only once
# somebody tries to make an image, which is later than it should be found.
ARG GO_VERSION=1.27

# Built on whatever the builder is and cross-compiled to the target, rather than
# emulated. Go needs nothing but two environment variables to do this and
# CGO_ENABLED=0 was already the rule, so an arm64 image builds on an amd64
# runner at full speed instead of through QEMU.
