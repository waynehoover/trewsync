/**
 * The stress suite: slow, hostile, and not run on every push.
 *
 * These are the tests that found four defects the 560 unit tests did not, all
 * of them silent. CLAUDE.md puts it plainly: unit tests are necessary here and
 * never sufficient, because every real bug this project has had only appeared
 * when the system ran. So this exists, and it is the gate before a release
 * rather than a thing to remember to do.
 *
 * One worker. These start real servers, write hundreds of files and kill
 * processes; running them beside each other would have them competing for the
 * same disk, and the first thing to give would be a timeout that means nothing.
