/**
 * What the two bundles are allowed to contain.
 *
 * The claim this project makes about its client is that the plugin and the
 * headless client are the same engine with a different adapter under them. That
 * claim is easy to make and easy to quietly break: one `import { readFile } from
 * "node:fs"` in `core` and the plugin still compiles, still passes every unit
 * test, and fails the moment somebody loads it in Obsidian, on a platform this
 * machine cannot run.
 *
 * So the bundles are built and read. A `node:` import reaching the plugin is the
 * exact regression, and it is invisible in every other test here.
