/**
 * Rotation across a process boundary, against a real server.
 *
 * The case this file exists for is the one an ordinary lost packet produces.
 * The server commits the new credential, closes every other registrar, and
 * only then answers; a connection that goes in between leaves the person with
 * a vault whose new root may exist nowhere but in this process.
 *
 * Protocol 4 changed where the durability lives. Rotation used to stage its new
 * secret in the device's own config and promote it on the next connection, and
 * there is nowhere to stage a root any more: a device does not hold one, which
 * is what makes revoking a single device mean anything. So the new key is
 * printed *before* the request goes out, and when the reply is lost the CLI
 * asks the server which secret it has rather than guessing.
 *
 * Both halves are here: the reply lost after the rotation committed, where the
 * answer is "the key above is the vault's", and lost before it, where the
 * answer is "cross it out".
