 * A Mac spells `café.md` on disk with a combining accent (NFD) and every other
 * platform with a precomposed one (NFC). The bytes differ and the name does
 * not: the two are canonically equivalent, one name by definition. A sync that
 * treats them as two names has two devices each refusing the other's spelling
 * for ever, and the refusal names two strings the person cannot tell apart.
 *
 * Real filesystem on the Mac side, because the spelling is the disk's doing
 * and an in-memory vault cannot have that property. The peer is in memory and
 * spells the name the way the plugin and every non-Mac device do.
