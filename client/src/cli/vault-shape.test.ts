/**
 * A vault shaped like somebody's actual vault.
 *
 * Every other test here uses a handful of files chosen to exercise one thing.
 * This one is the whole shape at once, borrowed from Sync Engine's benchmark
 * harness, which builds 1880 small notes, 100 medium files and 20 large ones
 * across folders up to six deep. That distribution is the useful part and it is
 * not what this project was testing against.
 *
 * Scaled down so it runs in a suite rather than a benchmark, and with one
 * change that matters: half the large files are incompressible. Their generator
 * writes prose, and prose is what hid the chunk-ceiling defect here for months,
 * because deflate made the sealed chunk smaller than the plaintext and the
 * overhead vanished into the saving.
