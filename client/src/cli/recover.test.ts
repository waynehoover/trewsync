/**
 * Recovery, end to end.
 *
 * The server has kept every version of every note and every deletion since the
 * first commit in this repository, and until now exposed none of it. For a
 * project whose first rule is not to lose a note, a safety net nobody can reach
 * is half a promise.
 *
 * Two read-only operations make it reachable, and restoring is deliberately not
 * one of them: a client fetches an old version with the ordinary `get` and
 * writes it back, so the server keeps exactly one way to change a vault. These
 * tests drive that through the real CLI, against a real server, with real
 * directories.
