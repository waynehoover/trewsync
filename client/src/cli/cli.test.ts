 * content of the reason for the one refusal that had no test at all, two
 * spellings that normalize to one name, whose sentence has to spell both names
 * out because they are identical on a terminal. The whole reason `spellOut`
 * exists is that "rename one of them" printed the same string twice and nobody

 * The two blocked kinds still ask for different things and still say so, which
 * is what the one list must not lose: two spellings of one name are both on
 * this device so the rename is here, while a file here and a folder elsewhere
 * waits on whichever device meant the other thing. Rule 7 asked for one list,
 * not for one sentence.
 *
 * A unit test on the renderer rather than a real sync, for the reason
 * `vault-spelling.test.ts` gives about the mechanism underneath it: a disk that
 * keeps NFC and NFD apart cannot be mounted on the machine this is written on,
 * so an end-to-end version would self-skip locally and a green run that is not
 * evidence is worse than no run (R9). The engine's side, including that it
 * builds these sentences at all, is covered over a real server in
