/**
 * One name, two spellings, on a disk that keeps them apart.
 *
 * A Mac stores `café.md` with a combining accent and every
 * other platform with a precomposed one: the two are one name, the vault
 * reports NFC, and reads, writes and the disk itself have to end up agreeing.
 * None of that can be exercised on the machine most of this is written on.
 * APFS folds NFC and NFD at lookup, so a vault can drop the whole mechanism
 * and every test still passes here, while ext4 keeps the two apart and the
 * note is lost. CI is Linux and would catch it; a local run would not, and a
 * green run that is not evidence is worse than no run at all (R9).
 *
 * So the normal form is injected. Here it is "the name without its tildes",
 * and `cafe~.md` and `cafe.md` are two files on every filesystem there is,
 * including this one. Nothing being checked below is a fact about Unicode: it
 * is one name, two spellings, and a disk that files them separately, which is
 * exactly what ext4 does with NFC and NFD.
 *
 * The NFC-specific behaviour keeps its own tests next door in vault.test.ts,
 * where they run against real NFD names and a real Mac disk.
