/**
 * Two devices that were apart, put back together, through the whole client.
 *
 * The pieces of this are each covered somewhere else and the composition was
 * not. `merge.fuzz.ts` owns `mergeText` and never touches a socket.
 * `engine.test.ts` runs two engines against a real server and gives them
 * in-memory vaults, so the filesystem adapter, the on-disk index and the
 * conflict copy's real name are all outside it. `cli.test.ts` drives two real
 * directories and asserts one shape at a time. What none of them does is let
 * both devices diverge in every way at once and then ask the three questions
 * that matter afterwards: did the two vaults converge, is every conflict copy
 * on both of them, and does the server's history still tell the whole story
 * from either side.
 *
 * Rule 10 of docs/design.md is why the assertions are shaped the way they are.
 * A conflict test that asserted the two devices agreed passed while one side's
 * edit had vanished, so agreement is checked *as well as*, never instead of,
 * every edit being present by name.
 *
 * Rule 6 is the other half: a deletion is an entry, so the history of a note
 * that was deleted and came back has to hold the deletion too. A history that
 * quietly starts at the version after the interesting one is the safety net
 * with a hole in it.
