/**
 * What a vault refuses to be told to write.
 *
 * The never-sync set was an upload filter and nothing else: `list` consulted it,
 * `watch` consulted it, and the write path did not. So a path this client would
 * never upload was a path it would happily accept, and both shells would write
 * into the config folder if a peer named one.
 *
 * That is not a small gap. `.obsidian/plugins/<any>/main.js` is executed by
 * Obsidian on the next reload, in a renderer with Node integration, so an
 * arbitrary write there is arbitrary code execution as the user. `.trew/`
 * holds this client's own pairing secret and server URL, and `.git/hooks/` runs
 * on the next checkout.
 *
 * It needs the vault key, so the attacker is a leaked pairing string or one
 * compromised device rather than a hostile server. It is also reachable with no
 * attacker at all: a client told its config folder is somewhere else uploads the
 * ordinary `.obsidian` it still has, and every other device would have applied
 * it.
 *
 * The invariant, asserted here for both vaults because the bug was that they
 * disagreed: a path this client will never upload is a path it must never
 * accept.
