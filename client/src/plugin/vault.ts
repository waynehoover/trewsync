/**
 * Obsidian's vault, as a vault.
 *
 * Uses `DataAdapter` for staged binary writes and serialized text updates.
 * Writes carry the incoming timestamps so a download does not look like a
 * new local edit on the next scan.
 *
 * ## Verification
 *
 * `fake.ts` models the inspected adapter behavior for unit and server-backed
 * tests. `scripts/open-note-smoke.mjs` also exercises actual Obsidian editors:
 * a correct file on disk is not enough if its tab follows a temporary rename.
 * Native Android filesystem and power-loss behavior still need device testing.
 *
 * ## normalizePath is not a formatting function
 *
 * Read out of the shipped `obsidian.asar`, it does four things, and two of them
 * change what file you are talking about:
 *
 *   - collapses runs of slashes and backslashes, and strips them from the ends
 *   - an empty path becomes "/", the vault root
 *   - a non-breaking space (U+00A0) or narrow no-break space (U+202F) becomes an
 *     ordinary space
 *   - the result is normalized to NFC, and macOS hands out filenames in NFD
 *
 * So `normalizePath(p)` can name a different file than `p`. The first version of
 * this file called it on paths that had just come back from `adapter.list`, then
 * skipped anything whose `stat` came back null, and the result was that a note
 * with a non-breaking space in its name disappeared from the listing entirely.
 * It would never have synced, and nothing would have said so.
 *
 * What is below keeps one keyspace. Everything the engine sees is normalized,
 * and where the adapter's own name for a file differs, that mapping is kept so
 * reads and writes still land on the real file.
 *
 * ## What the adapter's own writes are
 *
 * Also read out of the shipped bundle (`obsidian-1.13.7.asar`), because the
 * declarations do not say. `FileSystemAdapter.write` and `writeBinary` are
 * `fs.promises.writeFile` on the destination itself: the file is opened with
 * truncation and then written, so a full disk or a process killed between the
 * two leaves a note empty or short with no copy of what it held. And
 * `FileSystemAdapter.rename` throws "Destination file already exists!" when the
 * target exists, unless the two names differ only by case on a filesystem that
 * folds it. The Capacitor adapter was read again for 1.13.7 and makes the same
 * check with the same message and the same single exception before it hands
 * anything to the platform plugin, so the refusal is not desktop-only: what is
 * still the platform's is what happens if the destination appears between that
 * check and the rename, which is why `create` looks once more just before it.
 * So there is no replace-by-rename through this API on either platform, and
 * `replace` below says what is done instead.

   * On desktop the adapter is Electron's `FileSystemAdapter`, the vault is

   * this pass is opened and fsynced, and so is every directory whose

   * gives the adapter's own writes, which docs/plugin.md calls best effort.
   *
   * A directory that cannot be opened for syncing is logged once and not
   * raised. Windows refuses it, and a note that is itself synced with its
   * directory entry pending is a far better state than a pass that cannot
   * finish.
   *
   * A file is forgotten when it has been synced and not before. This used to
   * empty both sets first and stop at the first file that would not open, so
   * one transient failure skipped every later file in the pass and then lost
   * the record of all of them: the retry found nothing to flush, and the
   * index could be saved over notes that had never been made durable. Now
   * every file is attempted, the ones that failed stay for the next pass, and
   * the first failure is what the pass fails with.
   *
   * Keeping failures is only safe while a path that has gone is not one of
   * them. A file written and then deleted, here or by anybody else, cannot be
   * opened to be synced and has nothing left to make durable; counted as a

 *     fine behind a plugin that would not start. The staged copy is the way
 *     back: it is read when the live file cannot be, because it is complete and
 *     describes a state at least as new.
 *   - the journal is appended with `DataAdapter.append`, which is
 *     `fs.promises.appendFile(path, data, "utf8")` on desktop and Capacitor's
 *     `appendFile` with a UTF-8 encoding on mobile. Both were read out of the
 *     shipped bundle (`obsidian-1.13.7.asar`) rather than inferred from the
 *     declarations, and `append` is public from 1.7.2, which is this plugin's
 *     minimum. `appendBinary` is 1.12.3 and is not used for that reason.
 *   - there is no staged copy of the journal and there does not need to be. A
 *     record the adapter cut short is discarded by the next load and the
 *     records before it are not, so the failure a staged copy exists to
 *     prevent cannot happen here.
 *
 * What is still not offered is an fsync. The adapter has no way to ask for one,
 * so a record is durable when the platform says it is, exactly as a note is.
 * That is not a regression and it is not an improvement.
