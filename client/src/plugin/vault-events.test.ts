/**
 * The vault adapter, driven through sequences of Obsidian's own events.
 *
 * `vault.test.ts` beside this one asks whether each method does what it says.
 * This one asks a different question: after a run of the things a person does
 * to a vault, with the engine's reads and writes interleaved among them, is
 * every note still there and still itself. The methods can all be right and
 * the sequence still lose a note, because what a sequence changes is which
 * facts were true when.
 *
 * Five invariants are asserted rather than behaviour, and they are the whole
 * point of the file:
 *
 *   1. No note's content is lost, and no note holds another note's content.
 *   2. A write lands on the path it was given and on no other.
 *   3. Nothing is recorded as synced that is not on the disk that way.
 *   4. An interrupted sequence leaves a state the next pass can finish from.
 *   5. Nothing that still exists is missing from the listing, because a file
 *      the listing does not name is a file the engine reports deleted, and a
 *      deletion travels to every device (rule 6).
 *
 * The fifth is the one that catches the most, and it is the reason the fake's
 * index was made to hide dot-prefixed paths the way Obsidian's does: with a
 * kinder index the failure it describes cannot be reproduced at all.
 *
 * What is still not covered, and cannot be here: whether Obsidian fires these
 * events in this order in a real vault. The order below was read out of
 * `obsidian.asar` 1.13.7 rather than remembered, and the first describe pins
 * what was read so a future version changing it is noticed here.
