/**
 * Rotation from the plugin, against a real server.
 *
 * Rotation was a headless-client command, and the runbook for a lost device
 * therefore assumed a machine with the CLI was to hand. The device somebody
 * loses is a phone, and so, often, is the only other device in their pocket
 * (improvements.md §1 and §5). This file is what makes the row safe to offer,
 * and it is deliberately the same shape as `cli/rotate.test.ts`: the case that
 * matters is not the happy one, it is the ordinary lost packet.
 *
 * Protocol 4 moved two things. The panel asks for the current recovery key,
 * because no device holds one: a device that could rotate could also register
 * itself again after being revoked, which is the whole thing per-device
 * credentials removed. And every device keeps syncing across a rotation,
 * including this one, because no device row is touched.
 *
 * The server commits the new credential, closes every other registrar, and
 * only then answers. A connection that goes in between leaves a vault whose new
 * root may exist nowhere but in this process, and there is nowhere on a device
 * to stage a root any more. So the panel shows the new key and `settled` says
 * whether the server was heard from; when it was not, the plugin asks the
 * server which secret it has rather than guessing.
