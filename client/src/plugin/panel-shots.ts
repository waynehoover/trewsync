/**
 * The panel, in every state it has, written down so somebody can look at it.
 *
 * Two layout bugs have been found here by taking a screenshot and none by a
 * test: `de4d519` put the device rows above the row that offers them and
 * `dae9dcb` found four things in the history modal the same way. `main.ts:1907`
 * says it out loud, that a screenshot is a better reviewer of layout than a
 * test is. What that leaves is a review step that only happens when somebody
 * remembers to do it by hand, on a machine with Obsidian on it.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a screenshot, and cannot be
 *
 * Say it plainly rather than substitute quietly. A picture of this panel needs
 * Obsidian, and CI cannot have Obsidian:
 *
 * - The application is proprietary and is not redistributable, so no runner
 *   installs it. The local recipe is Electron's `capturePage` inside a running
 *   copy, on a machine somebody logged into.
 * - Native groups, rows, buttons and modal chrome come from Obsidian's theme.
 *   `styles.css` adds scoped layout for disclosures, the invite string and
 *   narrow screens, so the complete appearance still needs the running
 *   application.
 * - So a headless browser would need that stylesheet to draw anything true,
 *   and approximating it would produce a picture of a panel that does not
 *   exist. Rule: verify against the artifact, never infer. A rendering that
 *   looks like a screenshot and is not one is worse than no screenshot,
 *   because the next layout bug would be reviewed against a fiction.
 *
 * What CI can have is everything except the pixels: which elements the panel
 * builds, in what order, nested how, carrying what words. Some of what those
 * screenshots found lives in that half, and it is worth being exact about how
 * much, because overstating this would be the same sin as faking the picture.
 * `de4d519` was entirely in it: a container in the wrong place in a child
 * list. Of `dae9dcb`'s four, three were: the pane opened empty, the diff went
 * into the `<pre>` as one run of text with no spans for the colour rules to
 * match, and the modal never said which note it was. The fourth was not: the
 * pane rendered 314px wide inside 1080px of modal, which is geometry and has
 * no representation here at all.
 *
 * So four of five, and the fifth is the shape of everything this misses: a row
 * too narrow for its text, a button under Obsidian's floating close control, a
 * colour nobody can read. Those still need a person and a screenshot, and
 * `docs/assets/screenshots` is still where they go.
 *
 * The output is deliberately not a gate. It is uploaded so that it is always
 * there to look at, the way the todo entry asked, and so that a reviewer can
 * diff two runs by eye without anybody having to keep a golden file honest.
 * `panel-shots.test.ts` is the gate, and it checks the narrow thing a gate can
 * check: that the walk really reached every state and captured something real
 * in each.
 *
 * Everything here runs against the stub in `stub.ts` and a real `trewd`, so
 * the panel being captured is the panel the plugin builds, not a description
 * of it.
