/**
 * Obsidian's `DataAdapter`, faked well enough to be worth testing against.
 *
 * The plugin and its vault adapter are the only code here that cannot run in a
 * test, and "cannot be tested" was becoming a reason not to test it. This is the
 * other option: implement the interface the plugin talks to, faithfully, and run
 * everything above it.
 *
 * ## What makes it worth anything
 *
 * Two things, and without both it would be a mock that agrees with whatever the
 * code does.
 *
 * It is declared `implements DataAdapter`, against the real `obsidian.d.ts`, so
 * the compiler rejects a method whose shape has drifted from the real one.
 *
 * And the behaviour that matters is determined from the shipped application
 * rather than assumed. `normalizePath` below matches what Obsidian's does, which
 * was found by reading `obsidian.asar`: it does more than the name suggests, and
 * finding that out is most of why this file exists.
 *
 * ## What was read out of 1.13.7
 *
 * Written down because a fake nobody can check is a mock. Each of these was
 * found in `Obsidian.app/Contents/Resources/obsidian.asar`, and each was
 * something this file had wrong or had not modelled at all:
 *
 *   - `normalizePath` is four steps, two of which rename the file.
 *   - `rename` refuses an occupied destination, in *both* adapters, unless the
 *     two names differ only by case on a filesystem that folds it.
 *   - `list` is `readdir` with nothing caught around it, so a directory that
 *     is not there is an error rather than an empty listing.
 *   - `trashLocal` moves the path to `.trash/<basename>`, dropping the folders
 *     it lived under and numbering a name already taken.
 *   - The index leaves out every dot-prefixed path at any depth, and holds the
 *     vault root as a folder called `/`.
 *   - The desktop `trashSystem` lets Electron's refusal throw; the Capacitor
 *     one catches it and answers false.
 *
 * ## What it still cannot tell you
 *
 * Whether Obsidian calls these methods the way the plugin expects, whether the
 * app is in a state where the adapter is ready, and anything about the UI. Those
 * need Obsidian. What is covered here is every path through the plugin's own
 * code, which is where its bugs are.
 *
 * Two known simplifications, both in the safe direction. The real adapters put
 * every call through one queue, so nothing overlaps; this one is synchronous
 * underneath, and a test that wants an interleaving arranges it through
 * `fault`. And a real filesystem folds case per path component against the
 * directory it is in, where `insensitive` below folds whole paths against the
 * entries that exist.

 * Obsidian's `normalizePath`, as it actually ships.
 *
 * `normalizePath` is part of Obsidian's plugin API, whose declarations are
 * published under the MIT licence. The behaviour is not, so it was determined by
 * reading `Obsidian.app/Contents/Resources/obsidian.asar` and written out here as
 * the four steps it performs, so that this fake and the real adapter agree:
 *
 *   1. Collapse runs of backslash and forward slash into a single `/`.
 *   2. Strip leading and trailing slashes; an empty result becomes `/`.
 *   3. Replace U+00A0 and U+202F with an ordinary space.
 *   4. Normalize to NFC.
 *
 * Two of those four steps are surprising, and both matter to a sync client.
 *
 * It replaces a non-breaking space (U+00A0) and a narrow no-break space
 * (U+202F) with an ordinary space. A filename containing one is therefore a
 * *different filename* after normalizing, so a path handed to the adapter is not
 * always the path written.
 *
 * And it normalizes to NFC. macOS hands out filenames in NFD, so a path that
 * came from a filesystem elsewhere can change here too.
 *
 * Both mean the same thing for this client: the path the engine asked for and
 * the path that exists can differ, and the engine's whole idea of a file's
 * identity is its path.

   *
   * Two things it does that a plainer listing would not, both read out of
   * `obsidian-1.13.7.asar`:
   *
   * The vault root is in it, as a folder whose path is `/`. `fileMap` is
   * seeded with it before anything is scanned and `getAllLoadedFiles` returns
   * every value in `fileMap`, so the first entry the plugin sees is a thing
   * that is not a file and has no name.
   *
   * And nothing dot-prefixed is in it, at any depth. The scan tests each path
   * with a predicate that walks up the segments and stops at the first one
   * starting with a dot, and a path that matches is passed to
   * `reconcileDeletion` instead of being indexed. So `.obsidian/...`,
   * `.trash/...`, a `.git` anywhere, and this plugin's own staging copies are
   * invisible to `getAllLoadedFiles`, however plainly they exist on disk.
   * That is the whole reason a write under such a name can never be allowed:
   * it would land, never be listed, and be reported deleted on the next scan.
