/**
 * The index journal, on the two shells that actually run it.
 *
 * `core/index-journal.test.ts` pins the crash semantics where a crash can be
 * arranged exactly, with no I/O in the way, and `core/index-journal-store.test.ts`
 * pins the policy against a fake filesystem. Neither of them proves that the
 * thing is wired to anything. This does: every test here goes through
 * `JsonIndexStore` on a real directory or `ObsidianIndexStore` on the fake
 * adapter, which is the same code both shells ship.
 *
 * It exists because the journal was written, tested and imported by nothing.
 * A green suite over code the product does not run is the shape rule 9 exists
 * to refuse, and the way to keep it refused is a file that fails the moment
 * either shell stops using it.
 *
 * The crash points are one test each rather than one happy path, because this
 * is the file whose corruption the first rule is about and "it recovers" is
 * not a property: recovering from the four things that can actually happen is.
