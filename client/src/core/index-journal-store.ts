/**
 * The `IndexStore` the two shells share, written once over six file
 * primitives so that neither shell holds a copy of the crash semantics.
 *
 * `index-journal.ts` is the codec and this is the policy: when to append, when
 * to snapshot, and what to do with a log that cannot be trusted. Callers see
 * the same `load` and `save` they always did, and `load` hands back what it
 * found rather than a checked version of it, because the engine checks it
 * (`stored-state.ts`) and a store that refused first would replace a message
 * naming the bad field with one naming the file.
 *
 * The order that matters, and the only correct one: the snapshot is made
 * durable BEFORE the log is truncated. The other order can lose records. Its
 * cost is that a crash between the two leaves records already folded into the
 * snapshot, which is what the sequence numbers exist to make harmless.
 *
 * ## What binds a log to its snapshot
 *
 * A delta is only meaningful over the base it was computed against, so
 * applying one over a different base invents a state that never existed, which
 * is worse than any older index. Two things keep that from happening, and both
 * are needed:
 *
 *   - the sequence, which must continue the snapshot's exactly. An older
 *     snapshot restored under a newer log leaves a gap, and a newer one
 *     already holds the records.
 *   - the presence of `seq` at all. A snapshot written by anything other than
 *     this store has no sequence, so its `seq` reads as 0 and a log starting
 *     at 1 would line up with it by coincidence. That is exactly the shape of
 *     a foreign write, an editor's idea of tidy or a restored backup from
 *     before the journal existed, so a log is never applied to a snapshot that
 *     does not say which records it already holds.
 *
 * ## One writer
 *
 * A journal has the same single-writer requirement the whole-file index has,
 * and one failure the whole-file index does not: two writers number their
 * records independently, so their appends interleave into a log whose
 * sequences collide, and replay stops at the collision and silently drops
 * everything after it. The CLI's lock (cli/lock.ts) governs there and Obsidian
 * runs one plugin instance per vault, so this should not happen, and "should
 * not happen" is how a whole journal of state goes missing without a word.
 *
 * So both files are stamped after every write and checked before the next one.
 * A snapshot or a log that is not what this session left is somebody else's
 * write: it is said out loud, and the answer is a fresh snapshot rather than
 * an append, because a full snapshot is complete on its own and cannot be a
 * delta over the wrong base. That is last-writer-wins, which is exactly what
 * the whole-file store already did, and now it is audible.

 * them; the figures are in docs/research.md with the corpus. All three stay,
 * and the useful thing the measurement produced is knowing which one governs
 * where, because they turned out to bind at three different vault sizes:
 *
 *   - **40 notes, the floor.** A new vault's index is 20 KB, a quarter of that
 *     is 5 KB, and one record is 700 bytes: without a floor it rewrites the
 *     whole index every seventh pass, 22 times in 200 passes. With 64 KiB it
 *     does it twice, and the log it carries instead replays in 2 ms.
 *   - **1,000 notes, the fraction.** A 0.5 MiB index caps the log at 128 KiB,
 *     which is about 200 passes of editing. Load pays for it at 33 KiB/ms of
 *     replay, so 4 ms against the 5 ms it costs to read and parse the snapshot
 *     itself. That is the shape the fraction is for: the log's cost stays
 *     proportional to the snapshot's.
 *   - **10,000 notes, the record count.** A quarter of a 5 MiB index is
 *     1.3 MiB, some 3,200 passes away, so the cap fires first and is the
 *     better bound of the two: it holds the log at 380 KiB and replay at 12 ms
 *     whatever the vault weighs.
 *
 * Moving any of them is flat in this region. Halving the cap halves 12 ms of
 * replay and doubles the number of 13 ms snapshots, which is a wash, and the
 * fraction at 10% or 25% is 16 ms against 39 ms of worst-case replay on a
 * vault that snapshots once every few thousand passes either way. So the
 * numbers are kept, and they are kept because they were measured rather than
 * because they were written down first.
