/**
 * The wire, and nothing above it.
 *
 * This module knows the protocol and no policy: what a `put` looks like, not
 * when to send one. That boundary is the cleanest thing in Obsidian's engine,
 * where a 66-method engine collaborates with a 20-method transport that decides
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## Shape, taken from Obsidian's transport, and one thing not taken
 *
 * Read at `app.pretty.js:176823` onwards. Two decisions there are right and are
 * kept:
 *
 *   - **A queue for binary frames.** Bodies can arrive before the loop that
 *     reads them is running, so they are buffered rather than dropped.
 *     Obsidian's `dataQueue`.
 *   - **A timeout closes the connection.** A request that did not answer leaves
 *     the session's state unknown, and continuing on an unknown state is how two
 *     ends desync. Obsidian rejects and disconnects; so does this.
 *
 * The third, one promise slot resolved by the next reply that is not a
 * notification, is what this transport used to do and what request ids
 * removed. Matching a reply to a request by position produced three separate
 * defects here: an acknowledgement arriving from inside the last `send`,
 * before its waiter was armed, read as a reply nobody asked for; a
 * shutdown notice read as a bad reply; and the bodies of a refused fetch
 * consumed as the answer to the next one. Every request now carries an
 * `id` and every reply echoes it, so a reply is matched to its request by name
 * and a reply with no name is a notification or the reason the connection is
 * closing. docs/protocol.md, "Request ids".
 *
 * And one thing every client of this protocol has to do, which is worth saying
 * plainly because the first two written against it got it wrong: **replies are
 * multiplexed with notifications.** Another device can commit at any moment, so a
 * batch can arrive between any request and its answer. Anything that assumes the
 * next frame is its reply will read a batch as an answer and hang.
