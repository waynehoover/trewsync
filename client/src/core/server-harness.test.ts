/**
 * The client against the real server.
 *
 * These tests build `cmd/trew`, run it on a loopback port with a temporary
 * data directory, and talk to it with the actual transport. Nothing is mocked:
 * the sealing is real, the chunking is real, the SQLite writes are real, and the
 * assertions are checked by asking the server's own `verify` whether what it
 * stored is serveable.
 *
 * This is the test that could not be written until both halves existed, and it is
 * the one that matters: every protocol decision in docs/protocol.md was made on
 * one side of the wire, and two implementations that each pass their own suites
 * can still disagree about the wire between them.
 *
 * They did not, here. The whole file passed on its first run, which is exactly
 * when to go looking for tests that assert nothing, so each one below was checked
 * by breaking the transport and watching it fail.
