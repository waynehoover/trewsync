/**
 * Deterministic authenticated encryption, and the key schedule above it.
 *
 * This module has no reference to Obsidian, to the transport, or to any state.
 * The cleanest boundary in Obsidian's own engine is its encryption provider,
 * testable with no app present at all. This is the equivalent, and everything in
 * it can be exercised with WebCrypto and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why the sealing is deterministic
 *
 * Every other encryption layer you will read randomises its nonce, and for good
 * reason: reusing an AES-GCM nonce under one key is catastrophic. This one does
 * not, and the reason is load-bearing twice over.
 *
 * Paths must compare equal, or the server cannot tell two versions of one file
 * apart, and it holds no key with which to work it out.
 *
 * Chunks must compare equal, or deduplication silently does nothing. A chunk's
 * name is the hash of its *ciphertext*, so a random nonce would give every
 * upload a fresh name; content-defined chunking would still cut at exactly the
 * right boundaries and the client would then send every chunk anyway, for ever,
 * reporting success throughout. LiveSync randomises its per-chunk salt and can
 * afford to because it deduplicates on the plaintext hash instead. Trew
 * deduplicates on the wire, so the determinism has to be in the cipher.
 *
 * The nonce is HMAC of the plaintext under a separate key, truncated to 96
 * bits. This is deterministic AES-GCM, not AES-GCM-SIV. Identical plaintext
 * intentionally repeats its nonce and ciphertext; distinct inputs can collide
 * in the truncated nonce, so nonce reuse remains a probabilistic risk. The
 * construction and its limits are documented in docs/design.md, "The keys".
 *
 * What this concedes, and it belongs stated rather than buried: the server can
 * see that two chunks are byte-identical. That is not a leak being tolerated,
 * it is what dedup is made of.

 *     byte of the compressed stream on any edit, and the content-defined
 *     boundaries that make an edit cost one chunk would all move.
 *   - Before sealing, never after. Ciphertext is incompressible by design.
 *
 * Measured on a real vault, per-chunk deflate takes a full upload of its text
 * from 108% of the plaintext to 67%. Larger chunks compress better, but that
 * trade was measured too and lost: going from 256 B to 4 KiB averages saves
 * 3.8 MiB once and costs about 2.2 KB on every subsequent edit, so it pays back
 * after roughly seventeen hundred edits and a vault does far more than that.
 *
 * The codec is fflate rather than the platform's, because determinism is
 * load-bearing here. The same chunk has to seal to the same bytes on a desktop
 * and a phone or the names diverge and dedup silently stops working, and
 * "whatever zlib this runtime shipped" is not a guarantee. fflate is pure
 * JavaScript, so it is the same code everywhere.
 *
 * It is *not* byte-identical to zlib, and this comment used to say it was.
 * Measured: over 200 text samples, fflate at level 6 and `node:zlib` at level 6
 * agreed on zero of them. Both emit a raw deflate stream and the first bytes
 * match, so it is the same format and the same level choosing different
 * matches, not a framing difference -- on one sample fflate produced 61 bytes
 * where zlib produced 63. The two are interchangeable for anything that only
 * has to round-trip, and interchangeable for nothing here, because the sealed
 * bytes are what the chunk is named by.
 *
 * That matters more than the speed does. Compression is the slowest step in
 * sealing by some way: on 1 KiB text chunks it runs at 31 MiB/s against
 * 85 MiB/s for the encrypt and 91 MiB/s for the name, so it is about sixty per
 * cent of the cost, and `node:zlib` is 2.3x faster than fflate on the same
 * input. Taking that speedup would mean a desktop naming a chunk differently
 * from a phone, which is dedup quietly ending and every note re-uploading.
 * `compression-golden` is what holds the format still; this paragraph is what
 * stops somebody reading a false claim and swapping the codec for a win.
 *
 * A chunk that does not shrink is stored raw. The result is never larger than
