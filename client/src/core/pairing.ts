/**
 * The pairing string.
 *
 * "One binary, one pairing string" is the promise in the README, and this is the
 * string. Everything a device needs to join a vault is in it: where the server
 * is, which vault, and the vault's root secret, which is also what
 * authenticates to the server.
 *
 * It lives in `core` rather than beside the CLI because the plugin has to read
 * exactly the same string the headless client writes. Two parsers for one format
 * is two chances to disagree about a secret.
 *
 * ## Why it is one blob rather than three flags
 *
 * Because a person types it once, on a phone, off a screen. Three fields is
 * three chances to paste the wrong one, and a wrong *token* fails loudly while a
 * wrong *secret* fails as a vault that syncs happily and decrypts nothing. The
 * checksum below turns that second case into the first.
 *
 * ## Why the secret is in it at all
 *
 * There is nowhere else for it to be. The server never sees the passphrase or
 * the keys, so the server cannot hand them to a new device; the only thing that
 * knows the secret is a device that already has it. Anyone holding this string
 * has the vault, exactly as if they were holding the passphrase, and the CLI
 * says so when it prints one.
 *
 * ## One secret
 *
 * The auth key is a branch of the same HKDF schedule the root produces, and the
 * server stores only its hash, so the root is the only secret this string
 * carries. The format stays length-prefixed and versioned because it once
 * carried two.
 *
 * One secret in the string is not one secret in the system, since protocol 4. A
 * vault also has a data key, which the root wraps and every paired device
 * holds, and each device has a secret of its own. Neither is ever in here: this
 * string is the recovery key, and what it buys is a registrar session that can
 * register a device and hand it the data key.

 * optional second `#` is the vault name.
 *

 * `default` (R083-14). It could not, and the documented answer was to install
 * the CLI, run `trew init --vault-id` into a throwaway directory, issue an
 * invite from it, pair the plugin with that, then unlink and revoke the
 * throwaway device. That is a lot of steps to name something, and every one of

 * temporary.
