/**
 * What a saved index has to look like before the engine will believe it.
 *
 * Both index stores handed back whatever JSON they found, and `Engine.start`
 * then spread it into entries and remote states through casts. A file that was
 * valid JSON and nothing else, an index from a future version with a field
 * renamed, or one corrupted in a way that kept the braces balanced, all became
 * engine state: a cursor of `null` read as zero and re-downloaded the vault, a
 * pending list of numbers threw somewhere far from here, and an entry with a
 * hash but no chunks read as a file already synced.
 *
 * So the whole shape is checked, field by field, before anything changes. A
 * refusal names the field, because "the index is corrupt" is not something a
 * person can act on, and says what to do, because the answer is always the
 * same: the index is a cache of what the server and the disk agree on, and
 * both still exist.
