/**
 * Three-way text merge, and the one place TrewSync deliberately behaves worse than
 * Obsidian in order to behave correctly.
 *
 * Two merges live here, and the order they are written in is the order they
 * were built in. `mergeTextCharacters` is the character merge, which is most of
 * this file and every one of the seven checks below. `mergeText`, near the
 * bottom, is what a note actually goes through: it splits the ancestor into
 * diff3's regions and runs the character merge inside one of them at a time.
 * Read this header for what the character merge is doing and why it needs the
 * checks; read `mergeText` for what changed and what it was measured to be
 * worth. The character merge is still called on a whole file when a note has no
 * line structure to compute, so nothing here is dead.
 *
 * ## The construction, and the defect it inherits
 *
 * Obsidian's merge is diff-match-patch used the way its own documentation shows,
 * verified by reading `app.js:118574` in the released application. Four steps:
 * diff the ancestor against the local side; if the diff has more than two edits,
 * run `diff_cleanupSemantic` and then `diff_cleanupEfficiency` over it; build
 * patches from it with `patch_make`; apply them to the incoming side.
 *
 * `patch_apply` returns `[text, appliedFlags]`, and theirs returns index 0.
 * Discarding index 1 discards which hunks applied, so a hunk that could not be
 * placed is dropped and the result is returned as though it had succeeded. That
 * is a lost edit, reported as a success, which is the failure this project
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Every other step is right and is kept, including the two cleanup passes, which
 * make a merge read the way a human would write it. Dropping them would make our
 * merges worse in a way unrelated to the bug.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * The flags are checked, and any failure abandons the merge. The caller then
 * keeps both versions, one as a conflict copy. A visible duplicate is a small
 * annoyance; a silently mangled note is not.
 *
 * And then the outcome is verified rather than trusted. The flags are the
 * library's claim about its own work; what matters is the property, which is
 * that no local edit vanished. So every insertion the patch was built from is
 * checked to be present in the result. Rule 4 of docs/design.md is about
 * exactly this distance between an exit code and an outcome, and rule 10 is
 * about asserting the property that matters rather than a proxy for it: a
 * conflict test that asserts two devices *agree* passes while one side's edit
 * has silently vanished.
 *
 * Which turned out not to be enough on its own, and finding that out is the
 * reason this module is longer than a wrapper. diff-match-patch has no notion of
 * a conflicting region: it fuzzy-matches each hunk and says whether it landed
 * somewhere. So two devices rewriting one sentence differently both "apply",
 * and the result is a sentence neither of them wrote, with every insertion
 * present and the meaning destroyed. `conflictingSpans` is the check diff3 and
 * git make and this library does not, and it runs before anything is applied.
 *
 * ## The fourth failure, and why the merge runs twice
 *
 * Three checks were not enough, and the fourth one is the interesting one.
 *
 * `patch_apply` matches each hunk into the target by fuzzy search. In repetitive
 * content it can find somewhere that looks like the right place and is not.
 * Observed, with the real library, on a note of twelve similar sections: a local
 * edit to section 3 landed on section 6. Every flag true. The inserted text
 * present. The regions did not overlap. Every check above passes and the note is
 * wrong.
 *
 * So the merge is computed both ways round, and the two results must hold the
 * same lines. Applying the remote change to the local file has no reason to make
 * the same mistake as applying the local change to the remote file, so a
 * misplacement shows up as a disagreement about *which* lines exist.
 *
 * Same lines rather than the same string, because the two orders legitimately
 * differ in one common case: two devices each appending to a daily note. Nothing
 * is lost either way and only the order is arbitrary, so demanding identical
 * output would produce a conflict copy a day. A misplaced hunk changes which
 * lines exist, not their order, so the weaker comparison still catches it.
 *
 * ## The three the fuzzer found, and what a fuzzer is for here
 *
 * The four above each came from a note going wrong. Three more came from
 * merge.fuzz.test.ts, which generates the shapes nobody thought of and holds
 * the outcome to two properties: that a merge of edits on different lines is
 * the merge of those edits, and that every word in the result is a word
 * somebody wrote. All three are the same failure as the overlap check exists
 * for, a line or a word neither device wrote, reached by routes the overlap
 * check cannot see, because it compares spans and spans can miss each other by
 * one character.
 *
 * `fusedLine` is an added line whose only separator the other device deleted.
 * `splicedAdditions` is two devices rewriting one line with a space left
 * between their spans, so the two rewrites run together. `inventedWord` is the
 * outcome check under all of it: a word in the result that none of the three
 * versions holds. Each is documented where it is defined, with the case that
 * produced it and the cases that must go on merging.
 *
 * ## Which check catches what, measured
 *
 * Each of these was disabled in turn to find out, rather than reasoned about:
 *
 *   - **Overlapping regions** catches exactly one thing the rest do not: two
 *     sides rewriting the same sentence differently. diff-match-patch splices
 *     those, and it does so symmetrically, so merging both ways round gives the
 *     same mangled answer and the two-directions check sees nothing wrong.
 *   - **Two directions** catches a misplaced hunk, and catches two additions at
 *     one point that do not concatenate cleanly. Disabling it leaves four tests
 *     failing.
 *   - **The applied flags** catch nothing any constructed input reaches: with
 *     non-overlapping regions, `patch_apply` placed every hunk in every case
 *     tried, including with all four lines of context either side destroyed.
 *   - **Insertion survival** likewise. It is a check on the library's own report.
 *   - **fusedLine** catches a splice both directions agree on. Disabling it
 *     leaves two tests failing and, with `inventedWord` still in place, one
 *     generated case in a hundred thousand: a run-on of two real lines, where
 *     no single word is wrong.
 *   - **splicedAdditions** catches two rewrites of one line whose spans miss
 *     each other. Disabling it leaves two tests failing, and nothing else sees
 *     those: every word in the result is somebody's.
 *   - **inventedWord** catches a splice inside a word, which no span check
 *     sees because both spans are innocent. Disabling it leaves three tests
 *     failing.
 *   - **stillValid**, which is the caller's and not one of the seven, catches
 *     a merge that is clean text and broken structure. Only the caller knows
 *     how to judge that, so it is asked of `.canvas` and `.json` and of
 *     nothing else. Disabling it leaves two tests in canvas.test.ts failing,
 *     and 193 of the 2,429 canvases that merge cleanly in that file's
 *     generated corpus are files Obsidian will not open: one in thirteen, and
 *     nothing else sees any of them. `.svg`, `.xml` and `.csv` were measured
 *     for the same failure and do not have it, which is why they are not on
 *     the list: markup.test.ts, and `JSON_EXTENSIONS` in chunk.ts.
 *
 * The applied flags and insertion survival stay for the cost of a comparison
 * over data already at hand, and because the flags are the precise defect this
 * module exists to invert. What is not done is pretending they are tested.
 *
 * ## Why not node-diff3, which is the algorithm git uses
 *
 * `node-diff3` (3.2.1, June 2026, pure JS) does a real three-way merge with
 * proper conflict regions, which is precisely the notion diff-match-patch lacks
 * and which the checks above exist to reconstruct. On the face of it, it should
 * replace all of them.
 *
 * It was tried against the cases in merge.test.ts. It conflicted on five of the
 * eight that merge cleanly here, and caught nothing that the checks above miss:
 *
 *   - two devices appending to a daily note
 *   - two devices inserting at the same point
 *   - two words changed in one long paragraph
 *   - two words changed in one sentence
 *
 * The reason is granularity. diff3 is line-wise, and a Markdown paragraph is one
 * line, so any two edits to one paragraph collide. TrewSync's notes are prose,
 * where that is the common case rather than the rare one, and it would mean a
 * conflict copy most days for the most ordinary thing two devices do.
 *
 * That is still true of diff3 whole, and it is why `mergeText` takes diff3's
 * regions and not its answer: a region both devices touched goes to the
 * character merge instead of to a conflict marker. The library is still not
 * used, because what was wanted from it is a hundred and twenty-five lines of
 * code and the diff it needs is already in the bundle; see merge-regions.ts.
 *
 * diff-match-patch has shipped nothing since 2020, which is a risk this file
 * carries knowingly, and one that regions reduce rather than remove: the fuzzy
 * matcher now searches a few lines instead of a note.
 *
 * ## Where this sits, against Obsidian and LiveSync
 *
 * Obsidian merges silently and drops what does not fit. LiveSync mostly opens a
 * dialog and asks (`ModuleConflictResolver`), falling back to newest-wins for
 * binaries and identical content. TrewSync merges when it is clean and keeps both
 * when it is not, and never asks: there is no settings screen and no decision to
 * put in front of someone who wanted to write a note.

 * The first addition that the merge would join to the other device's addition,

 *
 * `conflictingSpans` asks about characters, and two devices rewriting the same
 * line can leave spans that miss each other. Found by the fuzzer's placed
 * property (case 1588304879), on a three-item list where each device rewrote a
 * different bullet and the bullets were next to each other:
 *
 * ```
 * base    - here\n- line sync\n- line
 * mine    - here\n- mine line here 1\n- line sync\nmine0 line
 * theirs  theirs added 0\ntheirs1 line sync\n- line
 * merged  theirs added 0\ntheirs1 mine line here 1\n- line sync\nmine0 line
 * ```
 *
 * `theirs1 mine line here 1` is a line neither device wrote, and `- line sync`,
 * the line theirs meant to rewrite, is left exactly as the ancestor had it. The
 * spans miss each other by the single space after a bullet: theirs deleted
 * `- here\n-` and mine deleted `line sync\n-`, so nothing overlaps, both
 * directions agree, every hunk lands and every insertion is present. This is
 * the failure the module's second paragraph promises to catch, escaping through
 * a one-character gap.
 *
 * So: two additions, one from each device, that end up on one line with only
 * spaces of the ancestor left between them are refused, but only when a
 * deletion across that gap took a newline with it. Both halves are needed and
 * both were measured:
 *
 *   - Without the gap test, two devices changing different words of one
 *     paragraph would be refused, which is the thing diff3 was rejected for.
 *   - Without the newline test, two devices changing *adjacent* words would be
 *     refused: `The cat sat.` against `The dog sat.` and `The cat ran.` leaves
 *     one space between the two edits and merges to `The dog ran.`, which is
 *     what both people meant. What makes the case above different is that the
 *     deletions took line ends with them, so the text each addition was written
 *     against is not merely edited, it is somewhere else.
 *
 * Two additions at one point are the other half of the same question. That is
 * the daily note when both are whole lines, so it stays a merge, and it is two
 * devices rewriting one word when either of them also took text away there
 * (case 3869976870, `- the the` against `- mine1 the` and `- theirs0 the`,
 * where theirs shares the opening letters and so deletes nothing, arriving at
 * exactly the point mine's replacement arrives at). Both orders have to keep
 * the two apart, because which comes first is the one thing this module leaves
 * open.
 *
 * What this does not close is written down rather than guessed at. The same
 * shape with ancestor text left standing between the two edits, where that
 * text is then absorbed into a word of the other side's insertion, still
 * merges wrongly at about two cases in a hundred thousand. It is described
 * with a reproduction in the header of merge.fuzz.test.ts, along with the rule
 * that would refuse it and what that rule was measured to cost.

/**
 * Merges `mine` and `theirs` over their common ancestor `base`.
 *
 * `base` is the content as of the last successful sync, which the local index
 * remembers as one hash per file. That single field is the most useful idea in
 * Obsidian's engine: it turns a three-way merge into something that needs no
 * version history at all.
 *
 * ## Regions, and why the merge no longer searches the note for a place to put
 * things
 *
 * Everything above reconstructs, from character spans, the one notion
 * diff-match-patch does not have: which stretch of the note each device
 * changed. Seven checks, each one a note or a fuzz case that went wrong first.
 * They work. What they are working around is that `patch_apply` decides where a
 * change goes by fuzzy search over the whole file, and a search over a whole
 * file can land in the wrong section. After that, every check is asking whether
 * a wrong answer looks wrong.
 *
 * diff3 does not search. It diffs both sides against the ancestor by lines and
 * cuts the ancestor into stretches: untouched, changed by one device, changed by
 * both. A change belongs to one stretch and cannot move to another, because
 * nothing looks for it a second time. merge-regions.ts computes that, and this
 * is what it is for.
 *
 * A stretch one device changed is **copied** from that device. No patch, no
 * matcher, no fuzz: the only decision anybody made about those lines was which
 * stretch they belong to, and the line diff made it. A stretch both devices
 * changed is the case plain diff3 gives up on, and giving up on it is why
 * node-diff3 was rejected here, because in prose it is two people editing one
 * paragraph. So that is the one place the character merge runs, on those few
 * lines, with all seven checks and nothing else in the file to misplace
 * anything into.
 *
 * ## Why checking the seams is enough
 *
 * The merged pieces are concatenated, and concatenation is where a merge invents
 * a line. So every piece but the last has to end a line. With that held, no line
 * and no word can span two pieces, because `\n` ends both, which is why the word
 * check inside a region is enough for the whole note and there is no second one
 * out here: a word the merge invented would have to be inside some region, and
 * that region already refused it against a smaller vocabulary than the note's.
 *
 * Without the seam check, the case that made `fusedLine` necessary walks
 * straight back in: one device writes into a blank line the other removed, the
 * region merges to a line with no newline left, and the next region runs into
 * it. Pinned in merge.test.ts under "merging inside line regions".
 *
 * ## What it is worth, measured
 *
 * merge.fuzz.run.ts, a million generated cases per mode, both merges on the same
 * seeds. Per hundred thousand cases:
 *
 * ```
 *                       merged   conflicts   defects
 *   placed   character  70,184      29,816       1.8
 *            regions    94,519       5,481       1.6
 *   tokens   character  57,321      42,679       0.2
 *            regions    85,266      14,734       0.1
 * ```
 *
 * A defect is a `merged` outcome whose text is not a merge of what the two
 * devices wrote, which is the only number that decides anything; the merge rate
 * is the number a person sees, because every conflict is a duplicate file
 * somebody has to reconcile by hand. Both improve, which is unusual enough to
 * be suspicious of, so the rest of this is what was done about the suspicion.
 *
 * The residue is not the same residue, and that matters more than the counts.
 * Over 300,000 cases of the oracle mode, all four of the character merge's
 * defects are a line neither device wrote, which is the failure this module
 * exists to prevent. Neither of the region merge's two is: every line in them is
 * some device's own line, and what is wrong is that an added line sits against
 * the wrong paragraph, in ancestors that genuinely read two ways. The one
 * documented in merge.fuzz.ts, where `mine1` lands on the other device's new
 * line, is gone; it now merges, correctly.
 *
 * The oracle's own bias is the thing to be honest about: the placed mode judges
 * a merge by applying two line-level edit scripts, which is close to what this
 * merge computes, so "fewer defects there" is weaker evidence for it than the
 * same number would be for the character merge. Three things that are not
 * circular say the same: the token mode has no model of a merge at all and finds
 * nothing; swapping the two devices over and merging again changes the lines in
 * neither merge, in 200,000 cases of each mode, which is the one property here
 * with no notion of a right answer behind it; and the four cases in
 * merge.test.ts that used to be refusals are now exact texts, checked by hand
 * against what the two devices meant.
 *
 * It is also about twice as fast on a large note, because two line diffs and a
 * handful of tiny merges cost less than four whole-file patch applications.
 *
 * ## What it costs, which is not nothing
 *
 * A merge that refuses less is a merge that decides more. Three specific things
 * to know:
 *
 *   - Where the ancestor reads two ways, the line diff picks one, and the merge
 *     is right about that reading rather than about what somebody meant. That is
 *     the whole of the remaining residue.
 *   - A device that deletes a whole paragraph while the other appends to the end
 *     now merges to the appended line, where the character merge kept both
 *     copies. Both edits are honoured and the note is much smaller. Rule 5 says
 *     a result smaller than its input is a bug until shown otherwise; here it is
 *     shown, by the device that did the deleting, and it is still the shape most
 *     worth watching.
 *   - The order of two lines added at one point can differ from what the
 *     character merge chose. Either is defensible, both devices compute the same
 *     one, and the daily note is pinned in merge.test.ts so a change to it is a
 *     deliberate act.

/**
 * Whether two merges made the same changes to the ancestor, in the same places.
 *
 * Not string equality, and the reason is not a shortcut. Two devices appending
 * to the same daily note is the commonest concurrent edit there is, and it is
 * order-ambiguous: merging their change into mine puts theirs last, merging
 * mine into theirs puts mine last, and both are right. Comparing the strings
 * exactly turns that into a conflict, which was measured rather than guessed:
 * five tests fail, the daily note among them.
 *
 * The first version of this compared the two results as multisets of lines,
 * and documented what that gave up: a line moved to different places by the two
 * directions compares equal. That was written down as a narrow hole and it was
 * not one. The fuzzer in merge.fuzz.test.ts reached it within its first few
 * hundred cases, and a hand-built case followed: a line added under Item 3
 * lands under Item 6 when the other device has removed the first three
 * sections, the same misplacement the two-directions check exists to catch,
 * with the text of every line unchanged. The same happens to a deletion when
 * every section holds a copy of the deleted line. Both are in merge.test.ts
 * under "with every line still present".
 *
 * So each result is described by where it changed the ancestor: every line it
 * added, tagged with the ancestor line it was added before, and every ancestor
 * line it removed, by index. Two results agree when those descriptions agree.
 * Two additions at one point by the two sides carry the same tag whichever
 * comes first, so the daily note still merges; a line added under the wrong
 * section carries a different tag and does not.
 *
 * Which lines are added and removed is decided by a line-wise diff of the
 * ancestor against each result, run to completion with no time limit. It is
 * one character per line, so it is small, and a time limit would make the
 * answer depend on the clock. The alignment it picks is a choice, and when a
 * result repeats a line that was already there, the choice could in principle
 * differ between the two results and refuse a good merge. The pinned case of
 * appending a line identical to the last one is there to notice if it ever
 * does; refusing is the safe direction, and it has not.

 * Shaped after Obsidian's, which is `<name> (Conflicted copy <device> <stamp>)`
 * with the stamp being `toLocaleString("sv")` stripped of separators to twelve
 * characters. Same idea, built from parts rather than from a locale, because
 * depending on Swedish formatting to produce an ISO-like date is a fine trick
 * and not one to rely on.
 *
 * TrewSync differs in *which* version gets this name. Obsidian puts the local
 * content in the conflict copy and overwrites the original with the server's, so
 * the file you have open changes under you and your version moves somewhere you
 * are not looking. Here the local content stays where it is and the incoming
 * version takes the new name: a sync you did not ask for never rewrites the file
 * you are editing.
