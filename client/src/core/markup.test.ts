/**
 * Whether `.svg`, `.xml` and `.csv` want the validity gate `.canvas` and
 * `.json` have, answered with a corpus rather than with taste.
 *
 * `stillValid` is the predicate `engine.ts` passes to `mergeText` for a path
 * `looksLikeJson` recognises. canvas.test.ts turned it from a precaution into
 * a measured check: 193 of 2,429 clean canvas merges are files Obsidian will
 * not open, one in thirteen, and no other check sees any of them. The obvious
 * next question was whether the same is true of the other structured formats
 * in `TEXT_EXTENSIONS`, which merge as text with nothing looking at the
 * result. A malformed SVG is as unopenable as a malformed canvas, so the
 * suspicion was reasonable.
 *
 * It is wrong, and the reason is structural rather than lucky.
 *
 * ## What the canvas failure actually is
 *
 * It is not "JSON is fragile". It is one character: the comma between two
 * siblings. `"edges":[]` is one line in the ancestor and three on each device,
 * both sides changed that line, and the character merge concatenates the two
 * edge objects with nothing between them. Every other check passes, because
 * nothing was lost and nothing collided. The file is one comma short of
 * parsing.
 *
 * **XML has no separator between siblings.** Two devices that each add an
 * element at one point produce `<rect/><rect/>`, which is exactly as
 * well-formed as either alone. There is no comma to lose. The failure class
 * that `stillValid` exists for does not arise, and the corpus below is here to
 * say so with a number instead of an argument.
 *
 * ## The numbers, measured by the property below
 *
 * The same document tree, the same mutations, four writers. Written as
 * Obsidian-canvas-shaped JSON, 299 of 17,415 clean merges do not parse, one in
 * 58. Written as SVG, in each of the three ways a tool writes one: 0 of
 * 18,229, 0 of 19,333 and 0 of 15,698. Fifty-three thousand merges, none of
 * them malformed.
 *
 * That control is the point of the file. A property test reporting that
 * nothing broke passes just as well when the corpus never reached the failure,
 * which is rule 10 in its usual disguise, so the run asserts that the JSON side
 * *does* break. The corpus reaches the failure class; XML is not in it.
 *
 * Twelve hand-built adversarial pairs are below as well, covering every
 * operation that could plausibly unbalance a tag: deleting a group somebody
 * else drew into, grouping, ungrouping, overlapping groupings, expanding a
 * self-closing element, mixed content, comments, CDATA. Five conflict and
 * seven merge. None is malformed.
 *
 * ## The verdict, and what it costs
 *
 * No gate for `.svg` or `.xml`. It would be a hand-rolled scanner in the most
 * durability-critical module, shipped to a phone, firing on nothing measured,
 * and a scanner that is wrong about some valid SVG would turn good merges into
 * conflict copies for ever. The alternative in the same breath, refusing to
 * merge these types at all, is worse and is measured too: 18,229 of the 34,546
 * attempts below merge cleanly, so it would turn 53% of them into conflict
 * copies in order to catch none.
 *
 * `.csv` is measured separately at the bottom, gets its own answer, and the
 * answer is also no, for a different reason. It does break, 600 merges in
 * 16,793, but what breaks is the row shape, and in all 600 every row of the
 * result is a row one of the two devices wrote, character for character. A
 * ragged table is a file every reader still opens with every edit in it. That
 * is not the canvas failure, which is total.
 *
 * If a future format does start producing malformed merges here, this file is
 * where it will show up first, because the property fails rather than the
 * count drifting.
