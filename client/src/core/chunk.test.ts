 * The boundary test, against the modulo it replaces.
 *
 * `(hash >>> 0) % avg === 1` was costing a libm call per byte on V8, which is
 * the engine the shipped CLI runs on, and every benchmark here was taken under
 * JavaScriptCore, which hid it. The replacement has to be exactly equivalent
 * and not approximately: a boundary that moved would rechunk every vault,
 * rename every chunk, and deduplicate against nothing.
 *
 * So this walks the arithmetic rather than trusting the algebra, over every avg
 * the size tables can produce and the values most likely to break it.
