 * `patch_apply` returns a pair; take the text and ignore the flags.
 *

 * ships, which was verified by reading `app.js:118574` in the released
 * application, and it is written here as the library's own usage pattern rather
 * than as a copy of theirs, because that is what it is: there is no other
