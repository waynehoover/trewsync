/**
 * Speed, as tests.
 *
 * Most of these assert **bytes on the wire**, not elapsed time, and that is
 * deliberate. Wall-clock assertions fail on a busy machine and pass on a fast
 * one, so they get loosened until they mean nothing; and the reason Telimus is
 * fast is not that its arithmetic is clever, it is that it sends less. That is a
 * property, and a property can be asserted exactly.
 *
 * The comparison throughout is against **whole-file sync**, which is what
 * Obsidian Sync does: its engine keeps one hash per file and pushes the entire
 * body on any change, verified in the extracted engine at
 * `obsidian-sync-engine.js:1778` where `readBinary(path)` feeds straight into
 * `push(..., hash, data)`. There is no chunk-level dedup to be had there, so an
 * edit to a large note costs the note.
 *
 * Wall-clock throughput lives in `bench.ts` and is reported, not asserted. The
 * chunker measures 575 MiB/s under `bun run` and 32 MiB/s under vitest, an 18x
 * spread from the runner alone, and a floor loose enough to survive that would
 * catch nothing. Reporting a number somebody reads beats a gate nobody trusts.
