/**
 * Which paths never sync, decided once for both shells and both directions.
 *
 * Each vault had its own list and its own way of consulting it, and the two
 * directions disagreed inside each one. The headless client refused an
 * ignored name only as the first segment on the way in and skipped it at
 * every depth on the way out; the plugin listed from Obsidian's index, which
 * omits every dot-prefixed path, and refused only five names on the way in. In
 * both, a peer could name a path this device would write and then never list,
 * and a path written and never listed is reported deleted on the next pass.
 * The peer then deletes its copy, on the word of a device that never had it.
 *
 * So one rule, here, and it is deliberately broader than a list: any segment
 * starting with a dot is never synced. That is what Obsidian itself does, it
 * covers every name that was on the lists (`.obsidian`, `.trew`, `.trash`,
 * `.git`, `.DS_Store`), and it is the same answer whichever shell is asking and
 * whichever way the path is travelling. A shell adds what only it knows: the
 * headless client's `node_modules`, and a config folder somebody renamed to
 * something without a dot.

 *

 * which has no name left in it at all; reading it as a name with no extension
 * makes `.gitignore 2`, which is the file it came from with a number after it.
 * Nothing dot-prefixed reaches these callers today, because `isNeverSynced`
 * refuses every dot segment in both directions, so the choice costs nothing

 * staging name is random rather than numbered, and both of those are the same
 * search with a different pen.
