/**
 * The transport against a server that misbehaves.
 *
 * `server-harness.test.ts` proves the client and the real server agree. It cannot
 * prove the client is robust, because the real server never lies: every
 * defensive check in the transport is unreachable when the peer is correct, and a
 * mutation pass against the integration suite showed exactly that, with nine of
 * eighteen breakages surviving.
 *
 * So this file supplies the lying peer. A gap in the batch sequence, a caught-up
 * at a cursor nobody reached, an entry outside its own range, a reply nobody
 * asked for: none of these can be produced by the Go server, and all of them can
 * be produced by a proxy, a version mismatch, or a bug on either side. The two
 * files are the same subject from opposite directions and neither is redundant.
