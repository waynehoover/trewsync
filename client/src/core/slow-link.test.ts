/**
 * Work that takes longer than one timeout, over a link that is slow but alive.
 *
 * Every wait in the transport was a deadline on the whole exchange: a fetch
 * had one timer across all its bodies, an upload one timer across the whole
 * drain, and the catch-up wait one across the whole backlog. A file larger
 * than the link could carry inside one timeout, or a backlog longer than
 * that, could therefore never complete, and the client reconnected into the
 * same work for ever. Nothing was lost and nothing arrived.
 *
 * The timeouts here are short and the link is throttled, so the work takes
 * several timeouts while bytes flow the whole time. What is being asserted is
 * that a timeout measures silence, not size.
