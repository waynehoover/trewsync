/**
 * A TCP proxy that adds latency, for measuring against a wire that is not
 * loopback.
 *
 * Loopback numbers say what the software costs and nothing about what a network
 * costs, and the two are not the same shape: latency multiplies round trips,
 * bandwidth multiplies bytes, and a design can be good at one and bad at the
 * other. Sync Engine's published figures were taken over 400ms of ping, which
 * is why that number appears here.
 *
 * Delay is applied to each direction at half the round trip, so `rttMs` is the
 * round trip a client experiences. Bandwidth, when given, is applied per
 * direction as bytes per second.
 *
 * Only ever used by benchmarks and tests, so nothing it does reaches a shipped
 * bundle.

   * segment overtake another does not model a slow network, it models a
   * corrupt one. An earlier version computed a delay per segment and handed

   * received a 151 byte fragment where a chunk should have been, which its
   * own check on the name caught.
   *
   * So there is one queue and one timer. A segment departs at the later of
   * when it arrived and when the previous one finished going out, plus the
   * time its own bytes take on the wire, and lands one way later. Departures
   * are therefore monotonic and so are arrivals.
