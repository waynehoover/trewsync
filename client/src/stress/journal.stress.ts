/**
 * The index journal, at a size where its cost is visible.

 * The unit tests pin what the journal does. These pin what it costs, because
 * two of the three things wrong with the first version were only visible in a
 * number: replay was quadratic in the size of the vault, and the snapshot
 * policy's floor was doing nothing on a small vault because nothing had ever
 * run it on one. Rule 8, which is where most of the real bugs here came from.
 *
 * Here rather than in the unit suite because these build indexes of tens of
 * thousands of entries and write to a real disk, and because the stress suite
 * is the gate before a release rather than the thing run on every save.
