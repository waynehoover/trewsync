/**
 * What the index journal costs, and what the snapshot policy should be.
 *
 * `docs/index-journal.md` proposed a quarter of the snapshot, 1000 records and
 * a 64 KiB floor and said all three were guesses. A guess in a constant is a
 * decision nobody made, so this measures the four things the policy is a
 * trade between:
 *
 *   - what a pass costs when it appends, against what it costs to rewrite the
 *     whole index. That difference is what the journal buys.
 *   - what a settled pass costs, which is paid on every watch tick for ever
 *     and is the one the whole-file store already had a skip for.
 *   - how fast a log is replayed on load, which is what a larger log costs.
 *   - how big a record really is, which is what turns "1000 records" into
 *     bytes and days.
 *
 * Run: `bun run src/stress/journal.ts`, or `NOTES=50000 bun run ...`.
 * Numbers land in docs/compared.md with the corpus they were taken on.
