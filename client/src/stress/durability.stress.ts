/**
 * What survives a process being taken away mid-write.
 *
 * Durability rule 1 says an ack means the body and the entry are both
 * committed. `stop()` sends SIGTERM and the server shuts down cleanly, which
 * proves nothing about that claim. These kill it outright.
 *
 * Both of these found nothing when first written, which is the point: they are
 * here so that the next change to the commit path cannot quietly break it.
