/**
 * Builds the Go server once for the whole suite.
 *
 * Every test file that talks to a real server used to build its own copy. With
 * fifteen files and four workers that is fifteen `go build` invocations of the
 * same package, all starting at once, all contending for the same build cache.
 * Usually wasteful and occasionally worse: the first run after a change to the
 * Go source produced a failure in whichever file lost the race.
 *
 * Building here happens before any worker starts, so the binary is simply there
 * by the time a test looks, and the path reaches the workers through the
 * environment they are forked with.
