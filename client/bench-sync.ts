/**
 * A whole vault through a real server, timed, and checked.
 *
 * `bun run bench:sync`
 *
 * The shape is borrowed from Sync Engine's benchmark harness: many small notes,
 * a few medium ones, a handful of large files, across folders several deep.
 * That distribution is closer to somebody's vault than anything this project
 * was measuring against.
 *
 * Two departures. Half the large files are incompressible, because prose is
 * what hid a defect here for months: deflate made the sealed chunk smaller than
 * the plaintext and a size bug disappeared into the saving. And correctness is
 * reported next to the timings rather than assumed, which is the good idea in
 * their harness and the reason to have read it.
 *
 * Timings here are localhost. They say what the software costs, not what a
 * network costs, and they are not comparable to a number measured over a link
 * with latency in it. docs/compared.md says what that means for comparisons.
