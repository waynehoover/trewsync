# Points compose.yaml and the docs at the newest published server image.
#
# Why this is not part of scripts/release.sh: the digest does not exist until
# the image does, and the image is built by CI from the `server/v*` tag. The
# order is commit, tag, push, wait for CI, then run this. A release script
# cannot pin what has not been published yet.
#
# Why the file is pinned at all, rather than saying `latest`: compose.yaml is
# the example somebody copies for the machine they keep running, and the whole
# point of a pin is that `docker compose pull` cannot move them to an image
# nobody tested against their devices. `latest` would make the example
# contradict the paragraph beside it.
#
# Forgetting to run this is caught: .github/workflows/ci.yml fails when the pin
# is older than the newest server tag, which is how it went two releases stale
# without anybody noticing.
#
# Reads the digest from the registry rather than computing or guessing it, and
# refuses if the tag is not published. No commit, no push: it edits the files
# and prints what changed.
